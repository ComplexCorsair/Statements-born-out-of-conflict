I wonder which one is even the real voice, which one actually speaks for what I want. I cannot remember when I became so obsessed with being socially and politically correct. I am sure it had begun before I could understand anything, let alone realise. This conflict between the obligation to fulfill the abstract definitions and my reasoning unable to point anything harmful to others in it, it tears me apart, slowly. I wonder how far I am to even deny my reasoning.
