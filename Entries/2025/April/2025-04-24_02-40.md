"Sometimes I feel like learning to simply be disinterested in people. If a person of my interests confides about themselves and their abstract world, I'd likely be curious with a spark in my mind. But I want to stop feeling that and be, "Oh, alright." Just end it on a generic note. Just start seeing people as black and white, bland. But then again, a handful among that colourless crowd, will have an inherent beauty, aesthetic, matter of intrigue in them. They will turn my world colourful again. 

   But will my world really become colourful again? Maybe it is rather my understanding of my perception."
