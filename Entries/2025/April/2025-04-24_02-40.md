"Sometimes I feel like learning to simply be disinterested in people. Like, if I'm talking to someone and they provide a superficial or deeper comment about themselves, their taste, ideals, beliefs, values, I will probably be interested in most of them by default. But I want to stop feeling that and be, "Oh, alright." Just end it on a generic note. Just start seeing people as black and white, bland. But then again, a handful among that colourless crowd, will have an inherent beauty, aesthetic, matter of intrigue in them. They will turn my world colourful again."
