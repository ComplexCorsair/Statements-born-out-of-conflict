To find my place and position in the revolving theatre, I must see and feel what the extremities are. Can't tell which one's the best chocolate without tasting, can I? I wonder just how far decision-making mainly fueled by observation goes. I believe the extremities are not where at least I am meant to belong. That is just not how I like things, maybe it's the same for most. Since forever, in most cases I've wished to be in the middle ground, to sit right at the middle of the see-saw. Maybe ambiguity and uncertainty is the actual truth. Well, pretty useless to try to determine that, at least right now.
