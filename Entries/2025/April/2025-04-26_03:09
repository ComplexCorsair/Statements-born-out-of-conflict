To see the most aesthetically pleasing and philosophically fulfilling people become a source of startle. The moment they showed a drastic shift in their facial expression and tone of speech, I felt my safety stripped away. To see a person expressionless their whole life, and one day to suddenly see them smiling. To see something become a source of horror from a source of comfort in a second. It is as if that person in themselves is worth no heed, let alone respect. It is as if I am only consumed in the world of mine, from me, to me and for me. How consumed most are in their personal constructs of an existence.
