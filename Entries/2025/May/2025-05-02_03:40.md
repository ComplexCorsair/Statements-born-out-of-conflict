I want so many things — love, wisdom, fame, influence, a certain lifestyle, a certain image, admiration, validation, food, shelter, clothing, fulfillment lf carnal desires, fulfillment of aesthetic values, ...... — so much. I can't blame myself for wanting any of it. Nor is it practical to expect the fulfillment of everything, maybe even half of it. So idealistic I am. Can't do anything but laugh at myself, at how childish I am. Or maybe that's what it means to be human.
