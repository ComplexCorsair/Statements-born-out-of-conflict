I am a bad person. I should not be allowed to exist. I'm abhorrent, hideous, despicable, disposable, unwanted, unacceptable, disgusting, ominous, worthless, unlikeable, intolerable, nauseating, an atrocity. I am not apt for this world. I must take my life, by any means. My desire for someone's warmth and understanding is wrong. I am wrong. Everything about me is wrong. I am an anomaly. An anomaly whose disappearance will affect nothing, yet everyone will be happy once I'm gone.
