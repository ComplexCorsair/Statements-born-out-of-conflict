I'm sorry
I don't want to live anymore.
I just want to die. I have not felt the grief so much in ages.
I don't want to look at myself.
I am a bad person. I should not be allowed to exist.
I'm disgusting
Ominous
Intolerable
Nauseating
Despicable, disposable, worthless, tiresome, atrocious, unlikeable
All my longing for warmth and understanding is wrong
I am wrong, I am an anomaly
I am not apt for this world
I should not be allowed to exist.
I'm just weak
Everyone's so miserable yet they stand strong
I whine like a petulant fucking man-child
And crave for love and admiration and shit
What I should be craving for is jumping off our building on some metal fence so the fencing impales my body and my filthy existence is over
Or craving for a bottle of phenyl
Even now I whine in front of you because my disgusting existence wants to be heard and shit
I should just kill myself.
(external input)
Then please end my life
I don't want anything anymore
I don't want anyone's love or admiration or warmth or understanding
I don't want to be happy no more
I just want to die
This is all weakness
I am weak, inept for this world
I should die
Everything will be fine once I die
I am weakness
Showing off my bullshit misery in front of others is weakness
Longing is weakness
Desires are weakness
Whining is weakness
I am only strong if I shut the fuck up, stop whining, man up and just suffer
I apologise for concerning you with all this
