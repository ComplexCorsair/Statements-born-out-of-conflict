My chest feels so heavy. I feel a tight clench. It's not sharp, but it's making breathing difficult. I think I should just remain single all my life. I'll tear the other one apart too, because how devastated of a being I am. The clench is so unbearable. I want someone to just randomly call me and talk to me. I don't want to reach out. Reaching out is bad, unnecessary. I... I just want to die as soon as possible. All my desires are invalid. I should die, everything will be fine then. If I get in a relationship, the other person - assuming to be mature - will probably force me to get therapy. I'll be obliged to because I would want them to be happy at all costs. But I don't want to reach out. No, I should just end it. The pain's so much. When does it end? I can distract myself but I don't even want to. It's just a cycle. It doesn't end, nothing will end. Only I am to end. I must cease to exist. I despise my craving to be heard and understood. I despise myself. I am unfit for love. I am unfit for relationships. I am unfit to be happy. I must die.
    I want someone to cry for me, hug me and comfort me. I don't even want the clenching to end, let it be. I should be miserable.
