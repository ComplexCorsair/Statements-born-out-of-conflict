# Statements-born-out-of-conflict
Sometimes I feel like I do not understand myself, sometimes I feel that I do. I am often in much conflict, most of the times I can not point out a single ingredient contributing to the conflict. It is fine, though.

I write because I long for being heard, being seen, finally(?). But something, I can't explain, lies behind that, the greater picture, profound. The longing surpasses the need for rationality, safety, self-preservation, self-esteem. Maybe it is something that is disconnected from and extends beyond the other needs.

This is how my current self feels. I do not understand myself. I must be a conflicting person. It is perfectly fine, though, till it isn't.

IMPORTANT: This repository contains random thoughts I have, as the name suggests. I will try to be as raw yet as orderly as I can.
