"Sometimes I feel like I do not understand myself, sometimes I feel that I do. I am often in much conflict, most of the times I can not point out a single ingredient contributing to the conflict. It is fine, though."

"I write because I long for being heard, being seen, finally(?). But something, I can't explain, lies behind that, the greater picture, profound. The longing surpasses the need for rationality, safety, self-preservation, self-esteem. Maybe it is something that is disconnected from and extends beyond the other needs. This paragraph is among those many thoughts, but it is special because it apparently has a direction, a purpose and much much clarity and confidence."

"This is how my current self feels. I do not understand myself. I must be a conflicting person. It is perfectly fine, though, till it isn't, a cycle, never-ending."

"I hope you'll find this interesting."

"Cat says meow. Cat is very meow."
